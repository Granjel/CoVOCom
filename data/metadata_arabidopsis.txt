code --- combination of population, genotype, treatment, and replicate; example: B14o2 (population B, genotype 14, treatment o, replicate 2)

population --- Arabidopsis seeds were collected in the field from two different populations, B or C, that correspond to two differentiated areas in the South of Spain; Xavier Pic√≥ (EBD-CSIC) collected and stored them

genotype --- Arabidopsis genotypes, denoted by different numbers; i.e., for population B: 3, 14, 24, 28, 30, 37, 53, 56, 57, 60, 61; and for population C: 1, 5, 8, 13, 15, 19, 26, 30, 34, 43, 45, 50, 55, 61, 64

treatment --- "o" for control (emitter plants not subjected to herbivory by Spodoptera littoralis) and "h" for herbivory (emitter plants subjected to herbivory by S. littoralis)

n --- replicate number, from 1 to 3 (each genotype per population and treatment is replicated three times)

larva_emitter --- weight (g) of Spodoptera littoralis larvae before being placed on emitter plants; zero values are given for the control treatment; weight after herbivory was not measured

size_emitter --- size of the emitter Arabidopsis plant on a qualitative scale: 1 (small), 2 (medium small), 3 (medium big), or 4 (big)

herbivory_emitter --- herbivory damage (percentage) caused by Spodoptera littoralis on emitter plants, calculated visually by comparing before-after pictures (the architecture of Arabidopsis makes it difficult to use software)

larva_receiver --- weight (g) of Spodoptera littoralis larvae before being placed on receiver plants

size_receiver --- size of the receiver Arabidopsis plant on a qualitative scale: 1 (small), 2 (medium small), 3 (medium big), or 4 (big)

herbivory_receiver --- herbivory damage (percentage) caused by Spodoptera littoralis on receiver plants, calculated visually by comparing before-after pictures (the architecture of Arabidopsis makes it difficult to use software)
